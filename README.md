Welcome to the XIP Host&trade; Project!
=======================================

The eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;) is an Open Source project the 
provides a framework for developing image processing and visualization applications.  
While XIP's emphasis is medical applications, it can be used for other types of
applications.

The XIP Host&trade; component of XIP&trade; performs the role of a DICOM Hosting 
System (see http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf).  It provides the 
infrastructure commonly needed by medical applications, such as DICOM network 
connectivity.  It provides access to NCI services found on caGRID, such as
NBIA and the AIM Data Services.  The XIP Host is written in Java using Swing.
