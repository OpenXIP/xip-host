***************************************
Overview
***************************************
XIP Host is a data access and manipulation component of Extensible Imaging Platform. 
XIP Host’s primary responsibility is DICOM and non-DICOM data query and retrieval 
from different data sources. Non-DICOM data example includes AIM XML annotation objects. 
Data sources currently supported by XIP Host include: local file system, AVT AD, DICOM PACS
and NBIA. XIP Host manages and invokes image rendering and processing applications compatible 
with DICOM Supplement 118 Application Hosting interface. This interface is and underlining 
communication channel between XIP Host and hosted applications.
XIP Host Reference Implementation is compliant with "File Access" and "Native Model" defined in DICOM Supplement 118.

XIP Host Configuration
***************************************
The following is the list of XIP Host configuration files:

1. XIPHost/config/xipconfig.xml – core XIP Host configuration file.

<tmpDir> directory used to store/cache data retrieved from different, remote data sources e.g. NBIA.  
         tmpDir directory content is cleared at the Host exit time. Any content placed under tmpDir 
         directory will be permanently deleted after Host termination. REQIURED.

<outDir> directory used to store output data received from XIP Hosted Applications. The content of outDir 
         is preserved between XIP Host subsequent launches. REQUIRED.

<StsUrl> URL address of the Secured Token Service (STS) used to validate user credentials and issue SAML
         assertions used across different data sources for authentication. OPTIONAL. 
         If STS parameters are not set, Host will allow Guest User login, and determine if communication
         with data source can be unsecured. 

<HostTrustStoreFile> absolute path of the truststore.jks file found in XIPHost/config/ directory. 
         Used by STS service. OPTIONAL.

<HostTrustStorePswd> password to truststore.jks. OPTIONAL – preconfigured for this release of XIP Host.

<useXUA>, <useNBIASecur>, <useSTS> only one of the three parameters must be set to true. Defines XIP Host 
         authentication module, used to verify and assign security credentials.

   

2. Data must be selected prior to any application launch. End user can select
   data from the local file system, query/retrieve data from the DICOM repository,
   caGrid or AVT AD repository.

3. XIP Host supports multi application management. More than one application can be
   ran at the same time. To switch between running application use tabs located on
   the right site of the host. 
   XIP Host allows also to run more than one instance of the same application at
   the same time. 

4. Worklist
   XIP Host Reference Implementation comes with a simple worklist functionality.
   The definition of each worklist entry can be found in:

         ..\xip-referenceimpl\XIP\config\worklist.xml
   
   Application assigned to worklist entry should be first added/registered with
   the host before executing worklist entry.

   To execute worklist item, click twice on a worklist entry. 
   Steps that follow:
        - DICOM and AIM data is retrieved from caGrid repository 
          and stored in TmpXIP directory
        - application is automatically launched, and dataset used for display or to be processed.

   Note: depending on the quality of the network connection and the volume of the
   data being retrieved, time to download data may take few minutes. 

5. To add XIP Application
      - 'Options / Add application' or
      - modify ..\xip-referenceimpl\XIP\config\applications.xml
      Note: Name and Path attributes are required. Path should point to the application
      executable file (.bat, .exe, .sh).

6. To terminate XIP application
      - select application's tab
      - select 'Exit' from the tool bar

7. To add/modify/remove grid and pacs location
      - modify grid_locations.xml or pacs_locations.xml accordingly
      Note: host verifies location parameters. If location does not pass validation test 
      it is not loaded at host startup.
