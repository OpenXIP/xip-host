*********************************************************
Overview
*********************************************************
XIP Host is a data access and manipulation component of Extensible Imaging Platform. 
XIP Host’s primary responsibility is DICOM and non-DICOM data query and retrieval 
from different data sources. Non-DICOM data example includes AIM XML annotation objects. 
Data sources currently supported by XIP Host include: local file system, AVT AD, DICOM PACS
and NBIA. XIP Host manages and invokes image rendering and processing applications compatible 
with DICOM Supplement 118 Application Hosting interface. This web services based interface 
is used to exchange data between XIP Host and hosted applications.
XIP Host Reference Implementation is compliant with "File Access" and "Native Model" defined in DICOM Supplement 118.
 
   
*********************************************************
XIP Host Configuration
*********************************************************
The following is the list of XIP Host configuration files:

1. XIPHost/config/xipconfig.xml – core XIP Host configuration file.

<tmpDir> directory used to store/cache data retrieved from different, remote data sources e.g. NBIA.  
         tmpDir directory content is cleared at the Host exit time. Any content placed under tmpDir 
         directory will be permanently deleted after Host termination. REQIURED.

<outDir> directory used to store output data received from XIP Hosted Applications. The content of outDir 
         is preserved between XIP Host subsequent launches. REQUIRED.

<AETitle> XIP Host DICOM default AETitle. OPTIONAL

<PdqSendFacilityOID> and <PdqSendApplicationOID> PDQ specific parameters. OPTIONAL

<StsUrl> URL address of the Secured Token Service (STS) used to validate user credentials and issue SAML
         assertions used across different data sources for authentication. OPTIONAL. 
         If STS parameters are not set, Host will allow Guest User login, and determine if communication
         with data source can be unsecured. 

<HostTrustStoreFile> absolute path of the truststore.jks file found in XIPHost/config/ directory. 
         Used by STS service. OPTIONAL.

<HostTrustStorePswd> password to truststore.jks. OPTIONAL – preconfigured for this release of XIP Host.

<useXUA>, <useNBIASecur>, <useSTS> only one of the three parameters must be set to true. Defines XIP Host 
         authentication module, used to verify and assign security credentials.

2. XIPHost/config/applications.xml - configuration file used to define hosted applications. Users can manually 
   modify the content of this file. Hosted applications can also be defined and registered with XIP Host 
   via GUI Options/Add Application. If manually entered hosted application parameters are determined not valid, 
   that particular application will be added to the list of not valid applications (Options/View Applications). 
   Application marked as not valid, can be right-clicked to edit. 

3. XIPHost/config/grid_locations.xml – file used to define NBIA and Grid data sources.
4. XIPHost/config/pacs_locations.xml – file used to define DICOM data sources.
5. XIPHost/connection.properties - file used to define AVT AD connection.

*********************************************************
Running XIP Host
*********************************************************

XIP Host is a standalone Java based application.
1. The first step is to compile the XIP Host source code. 
   To do so: using Terminal navigate to /XIPHost directory and type "ant". 

   Compilation step is required only once, before XIP Host is launched for the first time.

2. To launch XIP Host type: "ant run" in /XIPHost directory or double-click on either XIPHostRun.sh (Mac OS X) 
   or XIPHostRun.bat (Windows). If double click doesn’t run XIPHost ensure that XIPHostRun.sh is an executable file. 
   If not, change file mode/permissionwith :      sudo chmod u+x XIPHostRun.sh
                           
3. As an alternative, user can compile and run XIPHost all in one step.
    To do so either type: "ant clean all run" or double click XIPHostCompileRun.sh (Mac OS X) 
    or XIPHostCompileRun.bat (Windows).

Additional information: To be able to use AVT AD data source, IBM DB2 database must be pre-installed, separately from XIP Host.

Working with XIP Host and XIP Hosted Applications
*********************************************************

The typical XIP Host workflow steps include: 

1. Data source selection (select data source tab)
2. Query – returned query results are displayed in a tree structure. Some data sources support progressive query (e.g. NBIA, AVT AD). 
   Once first data nodes are returned, user can double-click on one of the displayed nodes to perform sub-query.
3. Data selection – user has to select at least one node before application launch.
   Right-clik on the node, expands the node.
4. Application launch – once data nodes are selected, user can click on any application displayed in XIP Host application bar. 
   If no application is displayed, user had to "add/register" new hosted applications manually (Options/Add Application). 
   When hosted application is started, communication process begins between XIP Host and hosted applications. Both components exchange 
   state notifications an references to data sets. Hosted applications can be rendering applications that require user input but they also can 
   perform analytical tasks and work independently from user input.
5. Application termination – some applications may terminate automatically after analytical tasks are completed. 
   Rendering application need to be terminated manually. User should select rendering application tab first and then click "Exit" button 
   found in XIP Host bar.
6. If XIP Host tab is selected and "Exit" button is clicked, all running hosted applications will be terminated first,
   and then XIP Host will exit.

7. XIP Host supports multi-application management. More than one hosted application can be run at the same time. 
   To switch between running application use tabs located on the right site of the XIP Host. 
   XIP Host also allows to run more than one instance of the same application in parallel.

*********************************************************
User login and switch user
*********************************************************

1. Login dialog is presented at the XIP Host startup.
2. User may choose to login as a "Guest User" (no authentication is performed). Guest user may only utilize unsecured connections.
3. When user name and password are entered, system will verify user credentials.
4. To switch user, click on "Switch User" button found in XIP Host bar. When switching from logged user to guest user, 
   all running hosted applications will be terminated, query criteria panels and result trees reset. User credentials would be invalidated.
